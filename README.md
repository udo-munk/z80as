# z80as
This is the Z80 cross assembler from Mark Williams Company,
written 1983 on PDP-11 COHERENT in K&R C. Release 1.0 is
the original source with bug fixes. I have converted the
sources then to ANSI C, so that the assembler can be compiled
on modern systems without warning, which is release 2.0.
